    "## Step 1: Training Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step of the notebook, you will customize the training of your CNN-RNN model by specifying hyperparameters and setting other options that are important to the training procedure.  The values you set now will be used when training your model in **Step 2** below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance! You are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** My architecture is base on the paper [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) where an encoder CNN \"reads\" the image and transforms it into a rich fixed-length vector representation, which in turn in used as the initial hidden state of a decoder RNN that generates the target sentence.\n",

    "![Model Architecture](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*E90mI7YT9F0J6b9EadxfzA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoder\n",
    "A convolutional neural network can be used to create a dense feature vector. This dense vector, also called an embedding, can be used as feature input into other algorithms or networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Embedding](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*tCeGt4fuK_gX1fh8OSyz1Q.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For an image caption model, this embedding becomes a dense representation of the image and will be used as the initial state of the decoder. On my solution, I've decided to use a pre-trained ResNet50 network without the last layer(the only fully connected layer in the architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decoder\n",
    "The decoder is an LSTM which is a recurrent neural network architecture that is commonly used in problems with temporal dependences. It succeeds in being able to capture information about previous states to better inform the current prediction through its memory cell state.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameters\n",
    "Regarding the hyperparameters, I mostly used the values suggested on the paper [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf). Instead of only training for 3 epochs(as suggested) I've decided to train for 5 to see how the loss and perplexity evolved and to test the model after a different number of epochs. After analysing the losses and the resulting inferences after training the model for different epochs, I came to the conclusion that(for this architecture and hyperparemeters) the ideal number of epochs is indead 3. The model seems to start to overfitting after 3 epochs. Reducing the learning rate after the initial epochs(with a LR scheduler), adding dropout and batch normalization or using a simpler model would be some of the solutions that we could try to solve this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - batch_size = 128                    # batch size\n",
    "    - vocab_threshold = 5                 # minimum word count threshold\n",
    "    - embed_size = 512                    # dimensionality of image and word embeddings\n",
    "    - hidden_size = 512                   # number of features in hidden state of the RNN decoder\n",
    "    - num_epochs = 3                      # number of training epochs\n",

    "### Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the image transformations that will be applied to your dataset. When creating these transformations, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I've decided to leave the transformations at the provided values because these are appropriate for the task at hand, including the minimum size of the input images and normalization required by the pre-trained model(ResNet50).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - transforms.Resize(256),                          # smaller edge of image resized to 256\n",
    "    - transforms.RandomCrop(224),                      # get 224x224 crop from random location\n",
    "    - transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),               # horizontally flip image with probability=0.5\n",
    "    - transforms.ToTensor(),                           # convert the PIL Image to a tensor\n",
    "    - transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406),      # normalize image for pre-trained model\n",
    "                           (0.229, 0.224, 0.225))])\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Regarding the encoder parameters, I've only trained the parameters of the last fully connected layer because the previous layers were already trained on the ImageNet dataset and can extracted the neccessary features from variety of images. Fine-tunning all the layers for a couple of epochs would be a possibility, but since ResNet50 is a pretty deep network, it would take a long time to do it when in conjuction with the decoder. The parameters of the decoder were all trained because this \"side\" of the architecture didn't include any pre-trained parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** For the optimization algorithm, I choose Adam which is a popular algorithm in the field of deep learning because empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods, leading to good results, fast."
